                        In addition to his academic research/teaching and
                        university/government service, Dr. Schmidt has three decades of
                        experience developing DRE middleware, model-driven engineering tools,
                        and mobile cloud computing apps.  He has led the development of the <a href="http://www.cs.wm.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html">ADAPTIVE
                        Communication Environment</a> (ACE), which is a set of <a href="http://www.cs.wm.edu/users.html">widely used</a>,
                        freely-available object-oriented frameworks that contain a rich set of
                        components that implement patterns for mission-critical DRE systems.
                        Dr. Schmidt and the <a href="http://www.cs.wm.edu/~schmidt/research-members.html">members</a>
                        of his <a href="http://www.cs.wm.edu/~schmidt/research-overview.html">research
                        group</a> in the <a href="http://www.cs.wm.edu/~schmidt/doc-center.html">Distributed
                        Object Computing (DOC) Group</a> at <a href="http://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/">Institute for Software
                        Intensive Systems</a> at Vanderbilt University have used ACE to
                        develop a high performance, real-time CORBA ORB endsystem called <a href="http://www.cs.wm.edu/~schmidt/TAO.html">The ACE ORB</a>
                        (TAO), which is a <a href="http://www.cs.wm.edu/~schmidt/corba-research-realtime.html">real-time
                        ORB endsystem</a> that supports end-to-end quality-of-service
                        guarantees over high-speed networks.  In turn, ACE and TAO form the
                        basis for the <a href="http://www.cs.wm.edu/~schmidt/CIAO.html">Component-Integrated
                        ACE ORB</a> (CIAO), which is a real-time <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/CCM/">CORBA Component Model</a> (CCM)
                        implementation built by the DOC Group. The DOC Group also developed <a href="http://www.cs.wm.edu/scoreboard/">CoSMIC</a>, which is
                        a collection of <a href="http://www.isis.v Vanderbilt.edu/Projects/gme/">domain-specific
                        modeling languages</a> and their associated analysis/synthesis tools
                        that support various phases of DRE system development, analysis,
                        configuration, and deployment. </p><p>

                        The middleware platforms pioneered by Dr. Schmidt constitute some of
                        the most successful examples of software R&amp;D ever transitioned from
                        academia to industry, being <a href="http://www.cs.wm.edu/users.html">used successfully</a>
                        by thousands of developers in hundreds of companies world-wide,
                        including Defense, Aerospace, Finance, Telecommunications, Medical,
                        Gaming, and Internet industries.  In collaboration with his
                        colleagues, Dr. Schmidt has applied these middleware platforms and
                        model-driven tools on large-scale telecommunications systems, medical
                        imaging systems, real-time avionic systems, and distributed
                        interactive simulation systems projects at many companies, including
                        BBN, Boeing, Cisco, Ericsson, Kodak, Lockheed Martin, Lucent,
                        Motorola, Nokia, Nortel, Raytheon, Qualcomm, SAIC, Siemens, Sprint,
                        and Telcordia. </p><p>
